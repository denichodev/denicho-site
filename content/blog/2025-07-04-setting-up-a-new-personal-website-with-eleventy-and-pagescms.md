# Thoughts on Setting up a new personal website with Eleventy and PagesCMS

## My old personal website

It's been a while since I actively maintained my [old website](https://denicho-dev-deni-chos-projects.vercel.app/). Back then, it was supposed to act like a business card, an easy link where people can get to know the most basic information about me and of course, for recruiter to download my CV to know even more. On top of that, it was supposed to be where I put my writings there. I made it with Svelte in a private repository (hence I can't link it and I have no plans on making it public). After years of having it live, I didn't manage to realize the "blogging" part of the site. I guess it's just that I think with my lack of experience in Svelte, making it work for a blog is just a pain in the ass.

## New personal website just dropped

Years has passed and I've been seeing the trend where people's website is stupidly simple. No fancy stylings, no huge JavaScript bundles with massive dependencies, and basically, no nonsense & no _bullshittery_. Here's the thing, when I was younger I'm always amazed by fancy buttons and nav bars, but now, I don't really care about it that much anymore, I just want it to be functional, **I just want to make it work**. That's basically where I stumbled upon [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev). Well, it does have a huge dependencies I guess, but in the end, what I needed is just a plain ol' html + css to get my points across. Like this post, this is my points that I want to get across.

## Starting up from scratch
