Heya, I'm Deni Cho. I'm Indonesian and currently somehow living 10,000+ km away from home in Germany. I'm sharing my life with my cat, Boba, who hardly lets me sleep in peace most of the time.

Professionally, I've been working as a Frontend Engineer for over 7 years now. What started as a dream to become a game dev kinda made me realise that I love to see what I've built! Take a look at what I'm [building](https://github.com/denichodev).

I play a lot of games as well. 'more stuff here...'

My next things to learn...
