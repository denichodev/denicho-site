Heya, I'm Deni Cho. I'm Indonesian and currently somehow living 10,000+ km away from home in Germany. I'm sharing my life with my cat, Boba, who hardly lets me sleep in peace most of the time.

I’ve been a Frontend Engineer for over 7 years now. It all started as a dream of becoming a game developer, but I realized that I absolutely love seeing the visual results of my work! Check out what I’m currently working on [GitHub](https://github.com/denichodev). Anyway, if you're a recruiter, you can download my [latest resume here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1br8N5CH2H2lQNEVI1Hmjz9odI4vDGMHk/view).


I’m a big gamer too! I love trying out different genres, from Action RPGs to MOBAs, and even some random indie games. I’m also into automation and even tactical FPS (I even made it to Immortal in Val once!). So, if you’re up for a chat about games, just let me know!


While you're wandering around this site, you might notice that there are not really any single focus of a specific topic. Well, that's exactly the point of the site. I'm sharing on whatever I feel like sharing. Be sure to check specific tags if you only care about a specific topic :).
